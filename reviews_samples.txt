REVIEW: For me and my dad so I‚Äôm always fighting my child to stop pulling on my bracelet. The bracelet transfer made of very thin stretchable plastic. They are grouped together to make a sturdy bracelet. But as the day goes on and it keeps getting stretched, one of those strands out of that group one do we sell for a snap. And every time it snaps the overall strength of the bracelet gets looser and looser‚Ä¶ And one day when you high 5 your your best bud, you‚Äôll see your bracelet fly off somewhere‚Ä¶ damaging the gems and hopefully the line doesn‚Äôt snap. Or you will lose many of your 20 beads. Besides that it‚Äôs an excellent bracelet very beautiful and I love the weight I feel on my wrist. And I can see why they used that particular line instead of something else because it feels more natural when it scratches it closes.
REVIEW: I order for my DIL because her name is spelled uniquely and it‚Äôs hard to find personalized item!  I received it today, Eyesore‚Ä¶. The letter is huge and the chain is cheap‚Ä¶ waste of my money and you can‚Äôt return it‚Ä¶. Darn
